Features

Data collection from CSV/API (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, time-series formatting)

Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizing trends, moving averages, volatility)

Models:

Machine Learning (Linear Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost)

Deep Learning (LSTM, GRU, RNN) for time-series forecasting

Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and trend accuracy

Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices
